The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall is a mod for the Legend of Bum-bo that fixes bugs, adds new features, and adjusts game balance.

To see the change list, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Shpim/The-Legend-of-Bum-bo-Windfall/releases) page.

## Installation
1. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/unity_mono.html) to install BepInEx in The Legend of Bum-bo game folder (The Legend of Bum-bo has a 64-bit executable). If you have the Steam version of The Legend of Bum-bo, you can find the game root folder by clicking `Browse local files` in the options menu on the game's page in your Steam library.
2. Download `The.Legend.of.Bum-bo_Windfall.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shpim/The-Legend-of-Bum-bo-Windfall/releases) page.
3. Unzip the mod file and move the folder entitled `The Legend of Bum-bo_Windfall` into the `Bepinex/Plugins` directory in the game folder.

To uninstall the mod, simply remove the mod folder from `Bepinex/Plugins`.

## Saved State
The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall changes how the game saves and loads your run. This can sometimes cause issues if a run is saved in vanilla and continued in Windfall or vice versa. If your saved run doesn't work after switching versions, switching back to the game version you started the run with will fix the issue.

To avoid this altogether, I recommend finishing your current run before installing or uninstalling The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall.

Your permanent progression (achievements and unlockables) is not modified by The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall and will not be lost when switching versions.

## Bug Reports
If you encounter a bug, please report it by opening an issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/Shpim/The-Legend-of-Bum-bo-Windfall/issues) page or by contacting me (see below).
If possible, try to submit images and/or video demonstrating the bug.

You can also view the console log while the game is running by editing the text file entitled `Bepinex` in the `Bepinex/config` directory and changing `Enabled` to `true` under `[Logging.Console]`. If an error occurs, it will show up in red text in the console.
