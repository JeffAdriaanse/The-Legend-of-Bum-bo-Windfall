## Additional Information
The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall is made for the Steam and GOG versions of the vanilla game, although it most likely works with the Epic Games version as well.

Windfall is made for Windows computers, so the mod might not work if you're using another operating system such as linux/proton.

Text that is added or modified by The Legend of Bum-bo: Windfall is not translated to all languages and will only display in English and Chinese.

Starting a new game without finishing your saved game will reset your win streak.

The ability to rewatch cutscenes exists in a debug menu in the vanilla game, Windfall just brings the feature to the main menu.
